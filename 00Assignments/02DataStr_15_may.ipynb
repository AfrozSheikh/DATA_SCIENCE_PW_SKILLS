    "# Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable is essentially a name that represents a value in memory. It allows you to store data of various types such as numbers, strings, lists, or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a variable in Python, you simply need to choose a name for it and assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=). Here's an example of declaring a variable called `age` and assigning it the value 25:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `age` is the variable name, and 25 is the value assigned to it. Python automatically determines the type of the variable based on the value assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also declare multiple variables in a single line by separating them with commas. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"John\"\n",
    "age = 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, two variables `name` and `age` are declared and assigned different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be assigned new values as needed, and the type of the variable can change based on the new value assigned. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "print(age)  # Output: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "age = 30  # Assigning a new value\n",
    "print(age)  # Output: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the variable `age` is initially assigned the value 25. Later, it is reassigned the value 30, and when you print its value, you get the updated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth mentioning that Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to explicitly specify the type of a variable. Python infers the type based on the assigned value."

    "# Q3 How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
    "In Python, you can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or constructors. Here are some common ways to convert data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integer to Float or String:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num_int = 10\n",
    "   num_float = float(num_int)  # Converts integer to float\n",
    "   num_str = str(num_int)     # Converts integer to string\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Float to Integer or String:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num_float = 10.5\n",
    "   num_int = int(num_float)    # Converts float to integer (truncates decimal part)\n",
    "   num_str = str(num_float)    # Converts float to string\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. String to Integer or Float:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num_str = \"10\"\n",
    "   num_int = int(num_str)      # Converts string to integer\n",
    "   num_float = float(num_str)  # Converts string to float\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. List or Tuple to String:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)\n",
    "   list_str = str(my_list)    # Converts list to string\n",
    "   tuple_str = str(my_tuple)  # Converts tuple to string\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. String to List:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   list_str = \"[1, 2, 3]\"\n",
    "   my_list = list(eval(list_str))  # Converts string to list using eval() function\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. String to Dictionary:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   dict_str = '{\"key\": \"value\"}'\n",
    "   my_dict = eval(dict_str)  # Converts string to dictionary using eval() function\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When converting from a string to another data type, be cautious about the format and validity of the string to avoid potential errors. The `eval()` function used in examples 5 and 6 can execute arbitrary code, so it should be used with caution, especially when dealing with untrusted input.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some examples of common type conversions in Python. The availability and appropriateness of conversion methods depend on the specific data types you are working with.\n"

    "# Q4. How do you write and execute a Python script from the command line?\n",
    "To write and execute a Python script from the command line, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code) and create a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write your Python code in the text editor. For example, let's create a simple script that prints \"Hello, World!\":\n",

    "   print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Open the command line or terminal on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if the script is saved on the desktop:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd Desktop\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once you are in the correct directory, you can execute the Python script using the `python` command followed by the name of the script file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python hello.py\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Hello, World!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer and the Python executable is added to your system's PATH environment variable. Otherwise, the `python` command might not be recognized."
