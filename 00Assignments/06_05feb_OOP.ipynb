    "### Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation:  bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It hides the internal details and implementation of an object from the outside world and provides access to the object's behavior through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes. It enables code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. A derived class (subclass) can inherit the attributes and methods of a base class (superclass) and can also add its own unique characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables methods to be defined in the superclass and overridden in the subclasses, allowing different implementations based on the specific objects being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction involves the concept of simplifying complex systems by providing only essential details and hiding unnecessary complexity. It allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define the common behavior and attributes for a group of related objects. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and building modular, reusable code.\n",

    "### Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example\n",
    "ans -> It is spicial method of the class which get call as soon as the class is created is i\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` function is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes or properties of an object and perform any necessary setup or configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of the `__init__()` method is to ensure that the object is in a valid and usable state after its creation. It allows you to define default values for attributes, accept arguments to initialize specific attributes, and perform any other initialization tasks required for the object to function correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of the `__init__()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def introduce(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of the Person class\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing attributes and calling methods\n",
    "print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(person1.age)  # Output: 25\n",
    "person1.introduce()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we define a `Person` class with an `__init__()` method. The `__init__()` method takes two parameters, `name` and `age`, which are used to initialize the `name` and `age` attributes of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an instance of the `Person` class (`person1`), we pass the values `\"Alice\"` and `25` as arguments. The `__init__()` method is automatically called, and the `name` and `age` attributes of `person1` are set accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the object is initialized, we can access the attributes (`name` and `age`) using dot notation (`person1.name`, `person1.age`). We can also call the `introduce()` method on the `person1` object to introduce themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` method is crucial for ensuring that objects are properly initialized and ready to be used. It helps to establish the initial state of an object and set up any necessary attributes or configurations."

    "### Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), `self` is used as a convention to refer to the instance of a class within its methods. It acts as a reference to the current object or instance on which a method is being invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self` parameter is the first parameter of instance methods in Python classes. By convention, it is named `self`, but you can choose any name for it (although sticking to the convention is recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why `self` is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accessing Instance Attributes: Within a class method, `self` allows you to access the instance attributes (properties) of the object. It provides a way to refer to the specific instance on which the method is called, enabling access to the instance's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calling Other Instance Methods: `self` is used to call other instance methods within a class. It allows one method to invoke another method on the same instance, facilitating code organization and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Differentiating Instance and Local Variables: `self` helps distinguish between instance variables (attributes) and local variables within a method. By using `self`, you can explicitly reference the instance variables and prevent them from being mistaken for local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implicitly Passed During Method Invocation: When you call an instance method on an object, Python implicitly passes the instance itself as the first argument, which is captured by `self`. This allows the method to operate on the specific instance and its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to demonstrate the usage of `self`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of the Person class\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the greet() method on the person1 object\n",
    "person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, `self` is used in the `__init__()` method to refer to the instance being created (`person1`). It allows us to assign the provided `name` argument to the `name` attribute of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, `self` is used again in the `greet()` method to access the `name` attribute of the instance (`self.name`) and print a greeting message.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `self`, you can work with the specific instance and its attributes within the methods of a class, enabling the encapsulation of data and behavior within objects in an object-oriented program."

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes. It enables code reuse and the establishment of hierarchical relationships between classes. Inheritance allows derived classes (subclasses) to inherit attributes and methods from a base class (superclass) and also add their own unique characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "Single inheritance involves inheriting attributes and methods from a single base class. It forms a linear hierarchy. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog barks.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Dog class and calling methods\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "print(dog.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks.\n",
    "In this example, the Dog class inherits from the Animal class using single inheritance. The Dog class has its own speak() method, which overrides the speak() method inherited from the Animal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "Multiple inheritance involves inheriting attributes and methods from multiple base classes. It allows a class to inherit from more than one class. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Father:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Mother:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, age):\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_age(self):\n",
    "        return self.age\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Father, Mother):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Child class and accessing inherited methods\n",
    "child = Child(\"John\", 5)\n",
    "print(child.get_name())  # Output: John\n",
    "print(child.get_age())  # Output: 5\n",
    "In this example, the Child class inherits from both the Father and Mother classes using multiple inheritance. The Child class inherits the get_name() method from the Father class and the get_age() method from the Mother class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilevel Inheritance:\n",
    "Multilevel inheritance involves a chain of inheritance where a derived class inherits from a base class, and another derived class inherits from the first derived class. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        super().__init__(brand)\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "class ElectricCar(Car):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model, battery_capacity):\n",
    "        super().__init__(brand, model)\n",
    "        self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of ElectricCar class and accessing inherited attributes\n",
    "car = ElectricCar(\"Tesla\", \"Model S\", \"100 kWh\")\n",
    "print(car.brand)  # Output: Tesla\n",
    "print(car.model)  # Output: Model S\n",
    "print(car.battery_capacity)  # Output: 100 kWh\n",
    "In this example, the Vehicle class is the base class, the Car class inherits from it, and the ElectricCar class inherits from the Car class. The ElectricCar class can access the attributes from both the Car and Vehicle\n",
